Install the same SmarterMail Build being used on the old hardware on the new server. (NOTE: Legacy Builds of SmarterMail can be found within your account on the SmarterTools website.)
Set up SmarterMail in IIS on the new server, using the KB article "Set up SmarterMail as an IIS Site in IIS10" as a guide.
Stop the SmarterMail Service (MailService.exe), and any IIS sites/application pools, on both servers.
Copy the Settings folder from your old server to your new one. By default that path will be C:\Program Files (x86)\SmarterTools\SmarterMail\Service\Settings. 
Copy the Domains folder from your old server to your new one. By default the path will be C:\SmarterMail\Domains.
Start the SmarterMail Service on the new server, and any IIS sites/application pools as needed.
Log in and re-activate the software on the new server.
If you change the path to your domains, you would need to edit your domains.json file accordingly to reflect the new paths.
If your IP address or other DNS info changes, update the corresponding setting in SmarterMail and restart the SmarterMail Service (or reboot the server) to make the change effective.
